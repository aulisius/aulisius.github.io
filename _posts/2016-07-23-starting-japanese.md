### Romaji

Essentialy English transileration

### Kanji

Chinese words imported into Japanese. Used for vocabulary words. Each Kanji has specific Japanese pronunciation

### Katakana

Used to write foreign (loaned) words. Can be used in the same way as italics in English. Used for onomateopeia

### Hiragana

Used for writing almost everything else.

Hiragana and Katakana share same sounds for different words.

# Hiragana in depth

Five basic vowels/kana

* a (ah) あ
* i (eee) い
* u (oo) う
* e (eh) え
* o (oh) お

All other kana are made of consonant and vowels

Ex. ka = K + a

The vowels form a 'pattern' (a, i, u, e, o)
