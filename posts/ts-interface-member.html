    <p>
      I recently came across a small requirement while adding types to a
      particular component. Consider the following type
    </p>
    <pre>
interface OrderDetails {
  createdDt: string;
  updatedDt: string;
  currentStatus: "Active" | "InActive" | "Deleted"
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      I need to show a list of them in a paginated manner and also provide
      filters to view a subset of them. <br />
      In this case, the filter would be on <code>currentStatus</code>. The type
      signature of my list was,
    </p>
    <pre>
type List = {
  orders: OrderDetails[];
  activeStatus: string;
}</pre
    >

    <p>
      Naturally <code>activeStatus</code> is kept as a string, but I'd like to
      go one step further and see if I can make sure that
      <code>activeStatus</code> can only be one of
      <code>"Active" | "InActive" | "Deleted"</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, there are two approaches to solving this requirement. One
      would be to create a new type for <code>currentStatus</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
type OrderStatus = "Active" | "InActive" | "Deleted";
interface OrderDetails {
  createdDt: string;
  updatedDt: string;
  currentStatus: OrderStatus;
}
type List = {
  orders: OrderDetails[];
  activeStatus: OrderStatus;
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      The above solution works wonderfully well if <code>OrderDetails</code> was
      a self-defined type but in this case, this came from a dependency that I
      had little control over.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other approach is to extract the type of
      <code>OrderDetails.currentStatus</code> and assign it wherever needed.
    </p>
    <pre>
interface OrderDetails {
  createdDt: string;
  updatedDt: string;
  currentStatus: "Active" | "InActive" | "Deleted";
}
type List = {
  orders: OrderDetails[];
  activeStatus: OrderDetails.currentStatus;
}</pre
    >
    <p>
      On surface this sounds like it would work, but sadly Typescript bugs out.
      I haven't fully investigated the reason, <br />
      but an educated guess is that this collides with parsing of
      <code>Namespace.Type</code> and hence TS disallows accessing members here.
    </p>
    <p>So then, what next?</p>
    <p>
      Thankfully, Typescript understands what I'm trying to do and shows an
      helpful error message
    </p>
    <code>
      Cannot access <b>'OrderDetails.currentStatus'</b> because 'OrderDetails'
      is a type, but not a namespace. Did you mean to retrieve the type of the
      property 'currentStatus' in 'OrderDetails' with
      <b>'OrderDetails["currentStatus"]'</b>?
    </code>

    <p>Once you apply the suggested fix,</p>

    <pre>
interface OrderDetails {
  createdDt: string;
  updatedDt: string;
  currentStatus: "Active" | "InActive" | "Deleted";
}
type List = {
  orders: OrderDetails[];
  activeStatus: OrderDetails["currentStatus"];
}
</pre
    >

    <p>
      Now with this, I am confident that I won't end up with a wrong value or a
      typo when using <code>activeStatus</code>.
