    <p>
      like the sunflower turns to the sun,<br />
      I see him turn to me
    </p>

    <p>but I don't understand</p>

    <p>
      like the thrush that sings into the night,<br />
      I hear his voice through his melodies as I fall asleep
    </p>

    <p>but I don't understand</p>

    <p>
      like the child who has discovered humor,<br />
      I hear his laugh at my jokes
    </p>

    <p>but I don't understand</p>

    <p>
      this feeling of wanting<br />
      this feeling of desiring
    </p>

    <p>but now that I have met her,</p>

    <p>I think I understand</p>
