    <p>I read stories of love on this earth</p>

    <p>from the time of Adam to now</p>

    <p>I see stories of love, told and recounted, made into movies and songs</p>

    <p>and I wonder, will history remember our love too?</p>

    <p>
      will they remember our struggle? our yearning, our dreams, our pain, our
      angst?
    </p>

    <p>
      in the far future, if they ever talk about us, what will they talk about?
    </p>

    <p>will it be the way I yearned for the warmth of your hand?</p>

    <p>or will it be the love in your eyes when you gaze upon me?</p>

    <p>
      I ask my love, will we be remembered? even a <em>little</em>? or not at
      all?
