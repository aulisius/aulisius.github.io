    <p>
      when our eyes meet, when the sight of you makes my day better,<br />when
      our eyes tussle and try to pierce each other's soul
    </p>
    <p>I realise <br />you don't need all your senses to love</p>
    <p>
      when our fingers touch,<br />
      when your palm fits perfectly in mine,<br />
      when you hold me
    </p>
    <p>
      I realise<br />
      you don't need all your senses to love
    </p>
    <p>
      when I hear your footsteps, <br/>when I hear the sound of your laughter, your
      anger and your silence
    </p>
    <p>
      I realise<br />
      you don't need all your senses to love
    </p>
    <p>
      when the air starts to smell like you,<br />
      it makes me feel safe,<br />
      makes me feel loved,<br />
      makes me realise
    </p>
    <p>you don't need all your senses to love</p>
    <p>
      in every bite that I take,<br />
      in every kiss that we share
    </p>
    <p>
      I realise<br />
      you don't need all your senses to love
    </p>
